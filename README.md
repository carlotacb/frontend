Hi! This is the code of the HackUPC 2020 landing page.

## Develop

Clone the repo and run `npm install` the first time:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:hackupc/hackupc-landing.git
cd hackupc-landing
npm install
```

Use `npm run start` to compile and serve the build directory in real time. It reloads everytime there's a change. Then view the website at [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000)

```sh
npm run start
```

## Deploy

**Push to master**. [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/sites/hackupc) will build and deploy automatically.

If you push something that doesn't build, don't worry, it won't be published.

## Support

If you need help understanding something of this repo you can ask the previous developers. The ones that made the 2020 edition are:
